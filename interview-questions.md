# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1.What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: The keyword 'this' in JS refers to an object.

  Researched answer: In JS the 'this' keyword refers to an object. It refers to different objects depending on the way in which its being invoked. It is a keyword and not a variable so the value of 'this' can't be changed.

2.What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on the web.

  Researched answer: React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components that we can use for multiple apps at once.

3.Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The render() method is required in a React class component.

  Researched answer: In React, the render() method is the only required method in a class component and is responsible for describing the view to be rendered. Coupled with the clever way React operates around its virtual DOM concept, there are certain subtleties in how this particular method works.

4.What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

  Researched answer: It was created as a syntactic sugar for React and compiles to HTML so that it can be written in a number of different formats, from plain old HTML to pre-compiled versions of it.

5.What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a software packaging system in JS.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a new package manager that replaces the existing workflow for the npm client or other package managers while remaining compatible with the npm registry. It has the same feature set as existing workflows while operating faster, more securely, and more reliably.

6.STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Anonymous functions in JavaScript are functions that don't have names.

  Researched answer: Anonymous Function is a function that does not have a name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before a function name to define a function in JavaScript. However, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function word without the function name.

1. Conditional rendering: Conditional rendering is the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. This concept is applied often in the following scenarios:. Rendering external data from an API. Rendering elements or components based on a condition for each element or component.

2. Props: Props are basically kind of global variable or object. They are used to pass information to a component using something called props (stands for properties).

3. JavaScript Events: HTML events are "things" that happen to elements in an HTML page. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, it can "react" on these events - just like a real-life computer program would react on a live network or mobile device.

4. Object-oriented programming: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

5. Ruby: Ruby is an open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
